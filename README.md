# DraftModeReroll
DraftModeReroll addon and automation script for Project Ascension

## Addon Usage
This addon allows you to create sets of spells and automatically rolls for you until you get them. It will create a macro that you need to keep in ability slot 1. There is no need to flip the cards over to learn spells. The addon will learn them for you. After it finishes one of your sets of abilities that you wanted, it will quit rolling. There is also spell categories that you can roll for (Examples: HOT, HEAL, BUFF, etc.). Just create up your ability sets that you want, enable them, run the macroClicker.py script, and let the addon do the work for you.

## Addon Setup
You need to move the WildCardReroll folder into your addons folder

<sub>Example path: \Project Ascension\Interface\AddOns\WildCardReroll</sub>

## Using the macroClicker.py script
**You need to have pyautogui installed: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html**

**You need to have python installed on your computer and added to path: https://www.python.org/downloads/**

Run the python file as administrator. The way that I accomplish this is by running Windows PowerShell as administrator, navigating to where I saved the file, and then running it. The script will count down from 5, allowing you to click into your running WOW application.

**IN ORDER TO STOP THE SCRIPT, MOVE YOUR CURSOR TO THE TOP LEFT OF YOUR SCREEN UNTIL THE SCRIPT STOPS RUNNING**

### Credit
This addon was originally created by somebody named lars for an early season of draft mode. The addon was broke after the first update and no longer available for people to download. I have been locally updating and maintaining it for personal use each season and wanted to allow others to also use it.
