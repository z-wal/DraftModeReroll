# DraftModeReroll
DraftModeReroll addon and automation script for Project Ascension

## Basic Addon Setup
You need to move the WildCardReroll folder into your addons folder
<sub>Example path: \Project Ascension\Interface\AddOns\WildCardReroll</sub>

## Using the macroClicker.py script
You need to have python installed on your computer and run the python file as administrator. The way that I accomplish this is by running Windows PowerShell as administrator, navigating to where I saved the file, and then running it. The script will count down from 5, allowing you to click into your running WOW application.
**IN ORDER TO STOP THE SCRIPT, MOVE YOUR CURSOR TO THE TOP LEFT OF YOUR SCREEN UNTIL THE SCRIPT STOPS RUNNING**
